I am into modern and retro gaming and am a former world-record holder for speed-gaming. My "category" 
was [The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past 100% Item Collection](https://youtu.be/X_0dAPkgxvo). 
While this was many years ago, it was a nice moment for me. I even participated in the 
[Games Done Quick](https://gamesdonequick.com/) charity events in 
[Summer 2011](https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/run/1012) and 
[Summer 2012](https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/run/1053).

Nowadays I enjoy a variety of genres including modern adventure games such as the new Zelda: Tears 
of the Kingdom, some older platforming games like Hollow Knight, and some even older games such as 
Final Fantasy V. I also dabble in eSports and follow the professional Dota2 scene to some degree.
