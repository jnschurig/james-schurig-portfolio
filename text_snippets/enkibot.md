Enkibot is a hints generator to help people participate in a charity event called the 
[Four Job Fiesta](https://www.fourjobfiesta.com/). In this event, people play a commonly 
available video game, Final Fantasy 5, with randomized restrictions such as character 
class limitations. The Enkibot app is there to provide strategic guidance for those who 
may not be familiar enough to play their assigned restrictions comfortably.

This app, [Ekibot-Prime-ST](https://enkibot-prime-st.streamlit.app/), is based on the 
original [Enkibot-Prime](https://enkibot-prime.herokuapp.com/). In this Streamlit (ST) 
version, I have rebuilt the UI using streamlit and implemented dataframe style data 
processing. With active feedback from the community, this app has seen some great 
enhancements. Check it out!
