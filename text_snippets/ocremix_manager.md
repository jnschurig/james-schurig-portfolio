OC Remix Manager is a Streamlit app designed to help manage local music files downloaded from a 
large database of free music from [Overclocked Remix](http://ocremix.org). This app manipulates 
files at the operating system level, and is therefore intended to be run locally, not in a remote 
environment. The app can catalog existing songs, download new ones from the Overclocked Remix 
library, play songs, and add arbitrary tags for searching and labeling. In future versions 
functionality will be added to create playlist objects based on search criteria and tag values.
