I love eating cheese, talking about cheese, and I even enjoy making it from time to time. Here is a small 
batch of _petit suisse_, made by me. It's a fresh, French cheese which is spreadable and delicious on just 
about anything you can think to put it on.

If you have the interest in hearing me geek out about cheese-making and dairy chemistry, feel free to ask. 
I'll tell you all about the process and talk your ear off until you are sure to be tired of me.
