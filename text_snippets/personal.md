From cheese-making to gardening to video games I have interests across the board and am easy 
to get along with. I have really enjoyed building relationships with various members of the 
data community and want to connect people to data and data to people. As a native Utah resident, 
I love taking my family and getting outdoors, trying new food, and experiencing the world around 
me.
