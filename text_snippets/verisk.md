I took a job at Xactware, recently been purchased by Verisk, doing technical support while 
I was studying in college. After some time there, I moved on to Service Quality Analysis, 
where I would listen to phone calls, read chat logs, grade them according to predetermined 
standards, give coachings to technicians, and generally try to help keep service quality 
high for support. I also started doing some reporting on most common issues and statistics 
related to this. This report was called the "Top 10" and featured our most common issues 
we saw in support. This was my first exposure to data and reporting. After a time, I 
applied for a testing role for a new thing called "Business Intelligence". I learned SQL on 
the job and started to get a hang for thinking in "sets". After being in QA for some time, I 
showed aptitude for development and was accepted as a Business Intelligence developer in 
July 2014.

As a junior developer, I learned from other talented developers and really grew into a 
professional. Being given the responsibility to maintain nightly load processes, I started to 
dislike monolithic processes that couldn't recover gracefully. I worked tirelessly to redesign 
our load paradigm to be more about individual components and eventually we retired the 
monolithic process and moved onto a process I had created which had several related, but 
separate components that could be run independently of each other. This new version ran 
faster, and more reliably than the previous one. It could also do batch-based processing and 
didn't require a single, huge nightly load to be successful. I believe this success is what 
really set my professional trajectory. 

I continued to grow in this role, and was able to take on more responsibilities such as 
training new developers and deepening my understanding of analytical modeling, eventually 
becoming a true expert as related to Xactware's data and analytical systems. 

Verisk decided that on-premise data centers were too costly, so they implemented a company-
wide cloud migration push. Our group was one of the first to adopt, and we chose Snowflake 
as our cloud-based database of choice. I was chosen to lead the migration effort and once I 
had tasted it, I honestly never wanted to go back.
