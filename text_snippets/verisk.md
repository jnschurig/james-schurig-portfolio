To help pay for college, I accepted a technical support job at a company called Xactware, 
which had recently been purchased by Xactware. Little did I know that it would shape the 
future of my career. Keeping an eye on internal opportunities, I worked and rose through 
the ranks, until I eventually applied for and was accepted as a quality assurance 
analyst for a new thing called "Business Intelligence". I learned SQL on the job and 
started to get a hang for thinking in "sets". After being in QA for a few years, I showed 
aptitude for development and was accepted as a Business Intelligence developer in July 2014.

As a junior developer, I learned from other talented developers and really grew into a 
professional. Being given the responsibility to maintain nightly load processes, I started to 
dislike monolithic processes that couldn't recover gracefully. I worked tirelessly to redesign 
our load paradigm to be more about individual components and eventually we retired the 
monolithic process and moved onto a process I had created which had several related, but 
separate components that could be run independently of each other. This new version ran 
faster, and more reliably than the previous one. It could also do batch-based processing and 
didn't require a single, huge nightly load to be successful. I believe this success is what 
really set my professional trajectory. 

I continued to grow in this role, and was able to take on more responsibilities such as 
training new developers and deepening my understanding of analytical modeling, eventually 
becoming a true expert as related to Xactware's data and analytical systems. 

Verisk decided that on-premise data centers were too costly, so they implemented a company-
wide cloud migration push. Our group was one of the first to adopt, and we chose Snowflake 
as our cloud-based database of choice. I was chosen to lead the migration effort and once I 
had tasted it, I honestly never wanted to go back.
