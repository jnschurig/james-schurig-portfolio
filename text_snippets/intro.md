I am a data- and data-systems enthusiast with a love of building useful tools and applications. 
After discovering Snowflake in circa 2016, I jumped in headfirst and haven't looked back since. 

With Snowflake as my preferred database, I have since expanded my repertoire to stored procedures 
in python and javascript as well as app development in python for command-line and Streamlit.

I enjoy optimization, organization, building data structures, improving systems in my care, and 
making useful systems and processes.
