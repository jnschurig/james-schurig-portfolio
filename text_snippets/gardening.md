While I don't always manage to keep on top of the weeds, I love to grow food in my garden. 
I especially enjoy making homemade salsa with homegrown tomatoes and peppers. 

I love cooking and enjoy experimenting with new recipes and iterating on new ones, trying 
to perfect them.

This year we have _**far**_ too many tomato plants, so I will definitely be learning some new 
preservation strategies.
