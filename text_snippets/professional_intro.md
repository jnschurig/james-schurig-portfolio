In my career I have helped multiple companies migrate to Snowflake and obtain stability on such. I have 
worked with Snowflake at all levels and can do virtually all tasks from account- and organization-level 
administration to detail-level development tasks such as optimizing query performance and building and 
debugging ingestion processes. As a huge fan of Snowflake, I have built some amazing data structures and 
processes using Snowflake-provided tools and orchestration, such as Snowpark and Snowflake tasks. 

Continually looking around me with eyes wide open, I seek for ways to improve the services I support, 
and to uplift those around me. I really enjoy getting to know those I work with and finding ways to teach 
and encourage growth from within. Through the course of my career I have been the recipient of wonderful 
mentorship and hope to be able to pay it forward.
