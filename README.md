# A Portfolio for James Schurig

A Streamlit app designed as a portfolio of work and projects relating to myself (James Schurig). 
It is here to help show my professional work, personality, and private projects that have helped 
contribute to my core skillset.

My hope is that any potential employer reading this might gain a quick understanding of who I am 
and what I can do.
